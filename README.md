# Age & Gender Detection with OpenCV
This project demonstrates a real-time age and gender detection application using OpenCV's Deep Neural Network (DNN) module. The application utilizes pre-trained models for face detection, age classification, and gender prediction. A webcam feed is processed to detect faces, which are then analyzed to predict the gender and approximate age group. The results are displayed directly on the video stream, overlaying bounding boxes and labels for each detected face. The project showcases how to integrate OpenCV's DNN capabilities to create efficient and interactive computer vision solutions.
